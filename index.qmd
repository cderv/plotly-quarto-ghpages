Let's make a Plotly figure:

```{python}
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
gapminder = px.data.gapminder()
gapminder2007 = gapminder.query("year == 2007")
fig = px.scatter(gapminder2007, 
                 x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", color="continent", 
                 size="pop", size_max=60,
                 hover_name="country")
fig.show()
```

Did it show up? ⤴️

If not, we can directly write out the HTML:

```{python}
pio.write_html(fig, file="plot.html", auto_open=False)
```

Now we can include it here:

```{r}
htmltools::includeHTML("plot.html")
```

What R packages got used here?

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
